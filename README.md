# Newsletter Cntent Curation Engine

### Site screenshot:

## ⚒️ Tools used

- Visual Studio Code: The entire site was written using React. The database and backend for the project will be uploaded to other repositories.

- Figma: I used Figma to organize the site layout. [You can view my design in this Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/YR6zX9im3b42CIIiKsVRT0/Newsletter-Engine?node-id=0%3A1).

## Resources

These are some resources I used to help me create this site:

- I adapted the hamburger menu to React from HTML/CSS/JS using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flItyHiDm7E) by Miguel Nunez (a.k.a. [Codefoxx](https://github.com/iamcodefoxx)).

- The site uses the [Garet font by Spacetype](https://garet.spacetype.co/). You can download the free font (along with their license) from their website.

## Hosting

- I'm hosting this site on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as a static website. Any update committed to this repository are continuously deployed.
